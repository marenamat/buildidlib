# Build ID Library

For debugging, one often needs to get binaries for the core file. This database
tries to harvest all the known build IDs from Linux distributions and link them
to the actual packages where you can find the appropriate debug info.

For now I'm trying just with Debian to see whether this may lead somewhere.
